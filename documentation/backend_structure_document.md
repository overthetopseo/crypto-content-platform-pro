# Backend Structure Document for `crypto-content-platform-pro`

This document outlines the backend setup, infrastructure, and hosting details of the `crypto-content-platform-pro` content platform. It is written in everyday language so that anyone—technical or not—can understand how the system works.

---

## 1. Backend Architecture

**Overview:**  
The backend is built using Next.js (version 13+) with its App Router and API Routes. This means:  
- The same codebase serves both the website pages and the server-side logic.  
- API endpoints live alongside UI code, making full-stack development straightforward.

**Design Patterns & Frameworks:**  
- File-based routing (Next.js App Router) for both pages and API endpoints.  
- Serverless functions (hosted by Vercel) for lightweight, on-demand compute.  
- Modular, component-based architecture: each feature (content, auth, webhooks) lives in its own folder.

**Why It Works:**  
- **Scalability:** Serverless functions automatically scale up when traffic spikes, then scale down to save costs.  
- **Maintainability:** A clear folder structure (pages, api, components) and an ORM layer (Prisma) keep code organized.  
- **Performance:** Next.js handles server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG) to deliver fast page loads and SEO benefits.

## 2. Database Management

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL  
**ORM Layer:** Prisma  
**Secondary Cache Store:** Redis (for caching hot data)

**How Data Is Handled:**  
- **Relational Storage:** Content, users, categories, tags, and scheduled posts are stored in structured tables.  
- **Caching:** Frequently requested data (e.g., recent articles, popular tags) is cached in Redis to reduce database load.  
- **Migrations & Versioning:** Prisma migrations keep the schema in sync across environments (development, staging, production).

**Data Practices:**  
- Regular backups (daily snapshots) of the PostgreSQL database.  
- Connection pooling via PgBouncer (managed by the cloud provider).  
- Strict input validation and sanitation through the API layer and Prisma.

## 3. Database Schema

Below is a high-level, human-readable overview of the main tables. Following that is a sample PostgreSQL schema in SQL.

### Human-Readable Schema

- **Users**: stores authors and admins (name, email, password, role).  
- **Content**: stores articles and posts (title, body, author link, status, publish date).  
- **Categories**: predefined topics (e.g., Market Insights, Technical Guides).  
- **Tags**: user or system-generated labels for content.  
- **Content_Categories**: links content to one or more categories.  
- **Content_Tags**: links content to tags.  
- **Scheduled_Posts**: holds posts waiting for future publication.  
- **Webhook_Events**: logs incoming webhook payloads, statuses, and errors.

### PostgreSQL Schema (Sample)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'author',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE content (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  author_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
  published_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE content_categories (
  content_id INTEGER REFERENCES content(id),
  category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (content_id, category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE content_tags (
  content_id INTEGER REFERENCES content(id),
  tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (content_id, tag_id)
);

CREATE TABLE scheduled_posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id INTEGER REFERENCES content(id),
  publish_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  received_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  success BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  error_message TEXT
);
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

**Approach:** RESTful API using Next.js API Routes. All endpoints return JSON and use standard HTTP verbs.  
**Authentication:** JWT (via NextAuth.js or custom middleware) in the `Authorization` header.  

### Key Endpoints

- **Auth & Users**  
  • `POST /api/auth/register` — create a new user  
  • `POST /api/auth/login` — authenticate and return a token  
  • `POST /api/auth/logout` — invalidate token or session  
  • `GET /api/users/me` — fetch current user profile

- **Content Management**  
  • `GET /api/content` — list all published posts (with filters)  
  • `POST /api/content` — create a new post (draft by default)  
  • `GET /api/content/:id` — retrieve a single post  
  • `PUT /api/content/:id` — update a post  
  • `DELETE /api/content/:id` — delete a post

- **Scheduling**  
  • `POST /api/schedule` — schedule a draft for future publication  
  • `GET /api/schedule` — list scheduled posts

- **Categories & Tags**  
  • `GET /api/categories` — list all categories  
  • `GET /api/tags` — list all tags

- **Webhooks**  
  • `POST /api/webhooks` — receive external events (market data, exchange notifications)  
    – Validates payload, logs to `webhook_events`, triggers downstream logic (update content, send notifications).

## 5. Hosting Solutions

**Backend & Frontend Hosting:** Vercel (serverless functions + global CDN)  
**Database Hosting:** AWS RDS for PostgreSQL  
**Cache Hosting:** AWS ElastiCache (Redis)  
**DNS & SSL:** Cloudflare (managed DNS, free SSL certificates)

**Why These Choices?**  
- **Reliability:** Vercel’s serverless functions run across multiple regions with built-in failover. RDS offers automated backups and multi-AZ deployment.  
- **Scalability:** Serverless functions auto-scale; RDS can scale vertically (bigger instance) or horizontally with read replicas.  
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay only for what you use (Vercel), and RDS Reserved Instances can lower costs long-term.

---

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer:** Handled by Vercel’s edge network—routes requests to the nearest serverless function.  
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Vercel’s global CDN caches static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts) near users.  
- **Cache Layer:** Redis caches hot API responses (e.g., homepage articles, tag lists) to speed up reads.  
- **Message Queue (Future):** A lightweight queue (e.g., AWS SQS) can buffer scheduled‐post jobs or heavy webhook tasks.  
- **Logging & Error Tracking:** Sentry captures runtime exceptions; CloudWatch collects function logs.  
- **Secrets Management:** Environment variables in Vercel for API keys, database URLs; AWS Secrets Manager for DB credentials.

---

## 7. Security Measures

- **Encryption In Transit:** HTTPS enforced across all endpoints (Cloudflare + Vercel SSL).  
- **Encryption At Rest:** AWS RDS data encryption and Redis encryption enabled.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  • JWT tokens with short expiry (e.g., 15 minutes) and refresh tokens.  
  • Role-based access control: authors vs. admins.  
- **Input Validation:** Joi or Zod schemas in API routes to sanitize and validate user input.  
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Prisma ORM parameterizes queries.  
- **Rate Limiting:** Throttle API requests (e.g., 100 requests/minute) at the edge.  
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Cloudflare WAF to block common attacks (XSS, SQLi).  
- **Regular Security Audits:** Dependency scanning (Snyk), penetration tests every quarter.

---

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring:** Datadog or New Relic tracks function cold starts, database query times, error rates.  
- **Uptime Monitoring:** UptimeRobot or Pingdom sends alerts if any endpoint goes down.  
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry logs exceptions with stack traces and user context.  
- **Database Health:** RDS automatic health checks and alerts for CPU, memory, connections.  
- **Backups & Recovery:**  
  • Automated daily backups of RDS with point-in-time recovery.  
  • Redis snapshots nightly.  
- **Maintenance Windows:** Scheduled maintenance (e.g., minor version upgrades) announced 48 hours in advance.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions runs tests and lints on each PR, and automatically deploys to the staging environment upon merge to main.
