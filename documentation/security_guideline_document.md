# Security Guidelines for `crypto-content-platform-pro`

This document provides comprehensive security practices tailored for the `crypto-content-platform-pro` application, a Next.js–based content management platform for the cryptocurrency domain. It aligns with secure-by-design principles, ensuring resilience and trustworthiness throughout development, deployment, and maintenance.

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

- **Robust Authentication**
  - Integrate a proven solution (e.g., NextAuth.js) with secure providers and JWTs.
  - Enforce strong password policies: minimum length (12+ characters), complexity, rotation schedules.
  - Store passwords using Argon2 or bcrypt with unique per-user salts.
- **Session Management**
  - Use HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=strict cookies for session tokens.
  - Implement idle and absolute timeouts (e.g., 15 min inactive, 8 hr max).
  - Protect against session fixation by regenerating session IDs after login.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define distinct roles (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).
  - Enforce server-side permission checks on every API route and page.
  - Deny by default; explicitly grant each permission.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Offer TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator) for privileged roles.
  - Enforce MFA enrollment for users with publish or admin privileges.

## 2. Webhook & API Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**
  - Terminate TLS (1.2+) at the edge (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare).
  - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **Input Validation**
  - Validate webhook payload schemas (e.g., JSON Schema).
  - Reject unexpected fields; enforce strict types.
- **Authentication & Signature Verification**
  - Verify incoming webhooks via HMAC signatures or shared secrets.
  - Reject requests older than a short window (e.g., 5 minutes) to prevent replay.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
  - Apply per-IP and global rate limits on API and webhook endpoints.
  - Return `429 Too Many Requests` when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**
  - Expose only the necessary API routes under `/api/`.
  - Limit external service permissions to minimum required scopes.

## 3. Input Handling & Output Encoding

- **Server-Side Validation**
  - Never rely on client-side checks alone; revalidate on the server.
  - Use libraries like Zod or Joi for schema enforcement.
- **Prevent Injection Attacks**
  - Use parameterized queries or an ORM (e.g., Prisma) for database operations.
  - Sanitize markdown or rich text to strip unsafe HTML (e.g., DOMPurify).
- **XSS Mitigation**
  - Apply context-aware encoding when rendering user content.
  - Employ a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict sources.
- **Safe Redirects**
  - Maintain an allow-list of internal routes before redirecting.

---

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encryption in Transit & At Rest**
  - Enforce TLS for all client–server and internal service communication.
  - Encrypt sensitive database fields (e.g., API keys, PII) with AES-256.
- **Secure Secrets Management**
  - Store environment variables in a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
  - Rotate secrets regularly; avoid plaintext checks into version control.
- **PII Handling**
  - Mask or redact personal data in logs and error messages.
  - Provide users the ability to export or delete their data (GDPR/CCPA compliance).

---

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

- **Security Headers**
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` restricting scripts, styles, fonts to trusted origins.
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to prevent clickjacking.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
- **CSRF Protection**
  - Use anti-CSRF tokens for all state-modifying requests (e.g., synchronizer token pattern).
  - Ensure the token is tied to the user session.
- **Secure Cookie Flags**
  - `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=strict` on session and CSRF cookies.
- **Client-Side Storage**
  - Avoid storing tokens or PII in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Server Hardening**
  - Disable unused services and ports.
  - Apply the principle of least privilege for CI/CD agents.
- **TLS Configuration**
  - Use modern ciphers (e.g., ECDHE, AES-GCM).
  - Disable SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1.
- **Deployment Pipeline**
  - Integrate vulnerability scanning (SCA) in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions + Dependabot).
  - Run automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) before merges.
  - Keep staging and production configurations separate.
- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - Centralize logs (e.g., ELK, Datadog) with structured JSON output.
  - Alert on anomalous behavior (e.g., repeated 500 errors, spike in 401s).

---

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Secure Dependencies**
  - Pin versions in `package-lock.json`.
  - Audit transitive and direct dependencies regularly.
- **Regular Updates**
  - Subscribe to security advisories for critical libraries (Next.js, React).
  - Schedule quarterly dependency upgrades.
- **Minimize Footprint**
  - Remove unused packages to reduce the attack surface.

---

## 8. Developer & Operational Practices

- **Code Reviews & Pair Programming**
  - Enforce peer reviews focusing on security implications.
- **Secure Coding Standards**
  - Document and enforce coding rules (e.g., `.cursor/rules/`).
- **Secrets in CI/CD**
  - Store secrets in encrypted vaults or CI secrets stores, not in code.
- **Incident Response Plan**
  - Define roles, communication channels, and recovery steps for security incidents.
