# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**Crypto Content Platform Pro** is a professional-grade web application designed specifically for the cryptocurrency domain. It provides content creators, marketers, and news teams with a unified environment for drafting, editing, organizing, and publishing crypto-related articles, analyses, and news posts. By combining a rich text editor, flexible scheduling tools, and SEO-friendly rendering, the platform solves the problem of fragmented workflows—where writers juggle multiple tools for writing, formatting, and deploying content—and the challenge of keeping crypto coverage timely and optimized for search engines.

The platform is built on a modern, event-driven architecture that listens to external data sources (like market feeds or exchange notifications) via secure webhooks. It leverages Next.js’s server-side rendering and static-site generation to deliver pages that load quickly and rank well in search results. The key objectives are:

*   **Seamless Content Creation:** Provide an intuitive, brand-consistent editing experience with custom typography and formatting tools.
*   **Automated Publishing:** Enable scheduling and external integrations so content goes live at the right time and social channels are notified automatically.
*   **Top-Tier Performance & SEO:** Ensure pages render quickly, meet SEO best practices, and support high availability during crypto market events.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Use a component-based approach and clear internal standards to allow rapid feature growth and consistent quality.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (Version 1)

*   Rich text editor for drafting and formatting crypto-focused content.
*   Tagging, categorization, and taxonomy management for articles.
*   Content scheduling with date/time picker and publish automation.
*   Webhook API endpoint to ingest external events (market data, social triggers).
*   SEO metadata management (titles, descriptions, canonical URLs).
*   Next.js-based server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
*   Basic user authentication with role-based access (editor, manager).
*   Custom global styles and font integration for brand consistency.

### Out-of-Scope (Deferred to Later Phases)

*   Multi-language content support.
*   Advanced analytics dashboard and in-depth user metrics.
*   Third-party CMS connectors beyond webhooks (e.g., WordPress API).
*   Mobile-first native app or React Native wrapper.
*   Subscription or paywall features.
*   Commenting system or community features.
*   Real-time collaborative editing.

## 3. User Flow

When a user logs in (typically an editor or content manager), they land on the dashboard showing upcoming scheduled posts and a summary of recent webhook events (e.g., market alerts). A left-hand navigation menu provides links to **Create New Article**, **My Drafts**, **Scheduled Posts**, and **Settings**. Clicking **Create New Article** opens the rich text editor with a toolbar for formatting, inserting images, and selecting custom fonts. Users write or import content, assign tags and categories, and preview SEO metadata in a side panel.

After drafting, the user clicks **Schedule**. A date/time picker lets them choose a publish slot. Upon confirmation, the platform queues the article for publication. At the scheduled moment, Next.js’s SSG pipeline pre-renders the page and deploys it to the CDN. Simultaneously, a webhook triggers external social media services or analytics platforms, notifying them of the new content. Users can later review published posts, update schedules, or override content instantly via the dashboard.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Rich Text Editor**: Formatting toolbar, custom fonts, code blocks, media embedding.
*   **Content Management**: Draft, edit, delete, and archive articles; tagging and categorization.
*   **Scheduling & Automation**: Date/time picker; automatic deployment; webhook triggers.
*   **Webhook API**: Secure POST endpoint for incoming events; customizable handlers.
*   **SEO Tools**: Metadata fields, slug editing, sitemap generation.
*   **User Roles & Auth**: Registration, login, password management; editor vs. manager permissions.
*   **Layout & Navigation**: Global header, sidebar navigation, customizable home dashboard.
*   **Branding & Styles**: Global CSS, custom font loading, theming placeholders.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (React) with the App Router.
*   **Backend/API**: Next.js API Routes (TypeScript); serverless functions for webhooks.
*   **Styling**: Global CSS, CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS (Emotion or styled-components).
*   **Fonts**: Custom `.woff` assets loaded from `/public/fonts`.
*   **Authentication**: NextAuth.js or custom JWT-based auth.
*   **Data Storage**: Placeholder for relational DB (PostgreSQL via Prisma) or headless CMS.
*   **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify for CDN-backed SSR/SSG.
*   **Integration**: Webhooks, optional React Query for data fetching.
*   **IDE/Plugins**: VS Code with ESLint, Prettier, Cursor plugin for coding rules.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Time to First Byte (TTFB) under 500ms; Lighthouse score ≥ 90.
*   **Scalability**: Handle spikes in traffic (e.g., major market events) with horizontal scaling.
*   **Security**: HTTPS-only; CSRF protection on API routes; input validation and sanitization.
*   **Usability**: Intuitive editor with inline help; responsive layout (desktop first).
*   **SEO Compliance**: Semantic HTML, meta tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt.
*   **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during critical publishing windows.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   Requires a stable Next.js 13+ environment with App Router support.
*   External services must support webhook callbacks to our defined endpoint.
*   Users have modern browsers that support server-rendered React and custom fonts.
*   Initial database schema will be defined later; PRD assumes a relational store.
*   Third-party analytics and social integrations use their own API rate limits.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**: External data providers may throttle webhooks; implement retry logic and rate-limit handling.
*   **Webhook Security**: Must verify payload signatures (e.g., HMAC) to prevent spoofing.
*   **Scheduling Conflicts**: Overlapping publish times could cause race conditions; enforce queue ordering.
*   **Content Previews**: SSR previews for unpublished content require secure preview tokens.
*   **Font Loading**: Fallback fonts must be defined to prevent layout shifts if custom fonts load slowly.
*   **SSR Caching**: Stale content risks if cache invalidation isn’t handled when articles update. Use incremental revalidation.

**Mitigation Ideas**: Implement exponential backoff for retries; use Prisma middleware for input validation; adopt ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) in Next.js; and define clear error-handling middleware in API routes.
